## Self-evaluation on Enigma

### Functionality - 3.0

  * I would like to give myself a 3.0 as I believe I have successfully implemented both the encrypt and decrypt methods in the Enigma class. Both encrypt and decrypt command line interfaces have also been successfully implemented. I also threw in some conditionals on key and date such that there's a sweet message if someone other than the "agent" who knows how to decrypt the message was not able to decrypt the encrypted message.

### Object Oriented Programming - 2.5 - 3.0

  * I am on the fence with this one. I did create at least one module that has a behavior used in both Encryption Algorithm and Decryption Algorithm classes. This project is broken up in relatively logical components; however, I believe I could have refactored more since several methods are quite long. If I had more time, I would have created more helper methods.

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics - 2.5

  * I believe the code is mostly and properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long, though some lines can be shortened. Most all classes and methods follow convention. I believe I chose the most efficient enumerables to be used but feel that I could have continued to refactor additional methods to shorten the lines of code.

### Test Driven Development - 2.5 - 3.0

  * Coverage of all methods is at 100%. I believe everything is tested, per coverage results. Some obvious edge cases are addressed and tested. Since I am new to coding, I feel that I may be missing something but have done my best to test everything I can.
