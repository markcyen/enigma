## Self-Evaluation on Enigma

### Functionality: 3.0

  * I would like to give myself a 3.0 as I believe I have successfully implemented both the encrypt and decrypt methods in the Enigma class. Both encrypt and decrypt command line interfaces have also been successfully implemented.

  * I also threw in some conditionals on key and date such that there's a sweet message if someone other than the "spy" who would know how to decrypt the message was not able to decrypt the encrypted message.

### Object Oriented Programming: 2.5

  * I am on the fence with this one. I did create at least one module that has "behavior" methods used in both Encryption Algorithm and Decryption Algorithm classes.

  * This project is broken up in relatively logical components; however, I believe I could have refactored more since several methods are quite long. If I had more time, I would have created more helper methods or perhaps another module. Additional time is needed to think about another module.

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: 2.5

  * I believe the code is mostly and properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long, though some lines can be shortened. Most all classes and methods follow convention. I chose the many different enumerables but feel that I could have continued to refactor and used efficient enumerables.

  * One hash is implemented at the end for the return value of the encryption and decryption though I relied on arrays to do the calculation for the encryption and decryption algorithms as well as for the conversion to shift array. I evaluated as easier for me to locate the index of each alphabet character and space.

### Test Driven Development: 2.5 - 3.0

  * Coverage of all methods is at 100%. I believe everything is tested, per coverage results. Some obvious edge cases are addressed and tested such as invalid key or invalid date. Since I am new to coding, I feel that I may be missing something but have done my best to test everything I can.
